# Recommended Codex Configuration for Formigio WIP
#
# Add these settings to your ~/.codex/config.toml file
# You can append them with: cat .codex-config.toml >> ~/.codex/config.toml
# Or manually copy the settings you want

# ============================================================
# Formigio WIP Configuration
# ============================================================

# Use a stronger model for planning and complex tasks
# Options: "gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4-turbo", etc.
default_model = "gpt-4o"

# Set approval mode based on your comfort level:
# - "auto": Codex runs commands automatically (fastest, requires trust)
# - "write": Codex can read freely but asks before writing/running commands
# - "read": Codex asks before any file operations
# - "ask": Codex asks before every tool use
approval_mode = "write"

# Recognize CLAUDE.md as a fallback instruction file
# This allows both Claude Code and Codex to work with the same repo
project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]

# Increase instruction file size limit (default is 32 KiB)
# WIP system has detailed instructions, so 64 KiB is recommended
project_doc_max_bytes = 65536

# Use medium reasoning effort for planning tasks
# Options: "low", "medium", "high"
# Higher reasoning = better planning but slower responses
default_reasoning_effort = "medium"

# ============================================================
# Optional: Sandbox Configuration
# ============================================================

# If you want to restrict Codex to only operate in your WIP directory:
# writable_roots = ["/Users/peter/my-wip"]

# ============================================================
# Optional: Git Configuration
# ============================================================

# Auto-approve git operations (since WIP system commits frequently)
# auto_approve_git = true

# ============================================================
# Usage Instructions
# ============================================================
#
# To apply these settings:
#
# Option 1 - Append to existing config:
#   cat /Users/peter/my-wip/.codex-config.toml >> ~/.codex/config.toml
#
# Option 2 - Manual copy:
#   Open ~/.codex/config.toml in an editor and copy the sections you want
#
# Option 3 - Start fresh (if no existing config):
#   cp /Users/peter/my-wip/.codex-config.toml ~/.codex/config.toml
#
# After updating config, restart Codex for changes to take effect.
